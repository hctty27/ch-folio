# Folio 2025

![image info](./static/social/share-image.png)

## Setup

Create `.env` file based on `.env.example`

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) then run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies
npm install --force

# Serve at localhost:1234
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Multiplayer

Multiplayer is optional and does not affect local driving when disabled. The MVP uses a Cloudflare Worker plus one hibernatable Durable Object per room.

Deploy the backend from `multiplayer-worker/`:

```bash
cd multiplayer-worker
npm install
npm test
npm run check
npm run deploy
```

Then copy `.env.multiplayer.example` values into the frontend `.env` and set the deployed Worker hostname:

```env
VITE_MULTIPLAYER_ENABLED=1
VITE_SERVER_URL=wss://ch-folio-multiplayer.<account-subdomain>.workers.dev/ws
VITE_MULTIPLAYER_ROOM=public
```

Rebuild the frontend after changing `VITE_*` variables. Open two browser sessions in the same room to verify remote SU7 movement. The first release synchronizes vehicle transforms, steering, wheel rotation and braking at 12 Hz with a 100 ms interpolation buffer; remote vehicles do not have Rapier collision bodies.

See `multiplayer-worker/README.md` for deployment and smoke-test details.

## Blender

### Export

- Mute the palette texture node (loaded and set in Three.js `Material` directly)
- Use corresponding export presets
- Don't use compression (will be done later)

### Compress

Run `npm run compress`

Will do the following

#### GLB

- Traverses the `static/` folder looking for glb files (ignoring already compressed files)
- Compresses embeded texture with `etc1s --quality 255` (lossy, GPU friendly)
- Generates new files to preserve originals

#### Texture files

- Traverses the `static/` folder looking for `png|jpg` files (ignoring non-model related folders)
- Compresses with default preset to `--encode etc1s --qlevel 255` (lossy, GPU friendly) or specific preset according to path
- Generates new files to preserve originals

#### UI files

- Traverses the `static/ui.` folder looking for `png|jpg` files
- Compresses to WebP
